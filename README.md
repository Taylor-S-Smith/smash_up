# smash_up
A Python script to model the popular card game Smash-Up

This is one of my first projects after learning python.
The goal was to make sure I understood all the basic concepts I was taught before working on a real-world coding project. 

Currently, only the 8 base game factions are available. Also, the text is not yet scaling based on screen/container size, so depending on the size of your monitor some of the game's graphics will not load correctly. This should be fixed shortly with a patch in the near future.

While there are plans to have card effects be computed automatically, right now the player will have to manually play cards, move cards, produce effects, and score bases.

Press 'c' at any time after initalizing the game to see a list of available commands.
